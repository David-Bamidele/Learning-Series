    "# Introduction To Recommendation Engines\n",
    "Recommendation engines (or systems) are algorithms that suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences, behavior, or patterns. They are widely used in e-commerce, media streaming, and social media to enhance user experience and drive engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-world Examples**:\n",
    "- **Amazon**: \"Customers who bought this also bought...\"\n",
    "- **Netflix**: \"Because you watched...\"\n",
    "- **Spotify**: \"Recommended songs for you\""
   ]

    "### **Types of Recommendation Systems**:\n",
    "Recommendation engines can be classified into several types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Collaborative Filtering**:\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is based on user behavior, i.e., it recommends items that similar users liked.\n",
    "- **User-based Collaborative Filtering**:     This method recommends items to a user based on what similar users have liked. It involves:\n",
    "    1. Finding similar users (using similarity measures like cosine similarity).\n",
    "    2. Recommending items that similar users liked but the current user hasn't interacted with yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering**: Instead of finding similar users, item-based collaborative filtering recommends items based on the similarity between items.\n",
    "    1. Calculate similarity between items.\n",
    "    2. Recommend items similar to those the user has interacted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Content-based Filtering**:\n",
    "This approach suggests items based on the features of the items that the user has shown interest in. For example, if a user likes action movies, the system will recommend other action movies based on their descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Hybrid Methods**:\n",
    "A hybrid recommendation system combines the strengths of collaborative and content-based filtering to improve accuracy. This could be done by averaging the predictions of both models or by using collaborative filtering when sufficient user data is available, and content-based when the data is sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "- Netflix uses a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations and content-based filtering to recommend movies with similar themes or genres."

    "`KNNBasic` from the Surprise library implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm specifically for collaborative filtering.\n",
    "It essentially creates a model that relies on the idea that similar users (or items) will have similar ratings. By leveraging the ratings of similar users, it makes predictions for users who have not interacted with certain items, aiming to provide personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Similarity Calculation**:\n",
    "   - **Computes Similarity**: It calculates the similarity between users (or items, depending on the `user_based` parameter). For user-based collaborative filtering, it measures how alike users are based on their ratings using a specified similarity metric (like cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Distance Metrics**: If `user_based=True`, it computes user-user similarities; if `user_based=False`, it computes item-item similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding Neighbors**:\n",
    "   - **K Selection**: After calculating the similarities, `KNNBasic` identifies the `K` nearest neighbors (most similar users or items) for each user or item based on the computed similarities. The value of `K` is a parameter you can set (often defaulted to 40 in Surprise).\n",
    "   - **Sorting**: It sorts the users or items based on their similarity scores to find the top `K`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prediction**:\n",
    "   - **Weighted Average**: When making predictions for a user-item pair, `KNNBasic` computes a weighted average of the ratings from the `K` nearest neighbors. The weights are determined by the similarity scores, meaning closer neighbors have a larger influence on the prediction.\n",
    "   - **Handling Unrated Items**: If a user has not rated an item, the algorithm uses the ratings from similar users to estimate a score for that item.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - **Sparse Data Handling**: It efficiently handles sparse datasets, which is common in collaborative filtering scenarios, as not all users will rate all items.\n",
    "   - **Optimization**: The algorithm is optimized to quickly find the nearest neighbors and compute predictions, though performance can still vary based on the size of the dataset and the value of `K`."

    "\n",
    "1. **Cosine Similarity Overview**: \n",
    "   - Cosine similarity compares the **angle** between two vectors. A value of `1` means they are perfectly aligned (same direction), and a value of `0` means they are completely orthogonal (no similarity).\n",
    "   - For binary data like this, cosine similarity can be thought of as comparing the **overlap** in the presence of specific genres between two movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretation of `cosine_sim`**:\n",
    "   The `cosine_similarity(onehot_df)` computes the similarity between each row (i.e., each movie) based on the one-hot encoded genre features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `cosine_sim` Output:\n",
    "Summary of `cosine_sim` array:\n",
    "- **1.0**: Perfect similarity (when the movies have the same genres).\n",
    "- **0.5**: Partial similarity (when they share one genre).\n",
    "- **0.0**: No similarity (no shared genres).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's break down the values from `cosine_sim`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All diagonal values are 1**, meaning each movie is perfectly similar to itself (`cosine_sim[0, 0] = 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Movies 0 and 1** (rows 0 and 1 in `one_hot_df`):\n",
    "  - They have the same genres: Action and Sci-Fi (`[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`).\n",
    "  - Cosine similarity between them is **1**, meaning they are perfectly similar (`cosine_sim[0, 1] = 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Movies 0 and 2** (rows 0 and 2 in `one_hot_df`):\n",
    "  - Movie 0 has Action and Sci-Fi, while Movie 2 has Animation and Family (`[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`).\n",
    "  - There is **no overlap** between the genres of these two movies, so the cosine similarity is **0** (`cosine_sim[0, 2] = 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Movies 0 and 3** (rows 0 and 3 in `one_hot_df`):\n",
    "  - Movie 3 has Drama and Sci-Fi (`[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]`), sharing only the Sci-Fi genre with Movie 0.\n",
    "  - They have a cosine similarity of **0.5** due to this partial overlap (`cosine_sim[0, 3] = 0.5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Movies 2 and 3** (rows 2 and 3 in `one_hot_df`):\n",
    "  - Movie 2 has Animation and Family, while Movie 3 has Drama and Sci-Fi, so there is **no overlap**, leading to a similarity of **0** (`cosine_sim[2, 3] = 0`).\n",

    "- **Cosine Similarity** measures the similarity between two vectors based on the angle between them.\n",
    "- In your case, it calculates how similar two movies are based on their **genre vectors**.\n",
    "- Itâ€™s a common metric for similarity in recommendation systems, particularly when features are represented as **binary or numeric vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Cosine Similarity Works:\n",
    "1. **Cosine of the Angle**: \n",
    "   - The cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in an **n-dimensional space**.\n",
    "   - If two vectors point in the same direction, the cosine similarity is **1** (maximum similarity).\n",
    "   - If two vectors are at **90 degrees** to each other, the cosine similarity is **0** (no similarity).\n",
    "   - If two vectors point in completely opposite directions, the cosine similarity is **-1** (maximum dissimilarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "   The formula for cosine similarity between two vectors \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\text{cosine_similarity}(A, B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\| \\|B\\|}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - $ A \\cdot B $ is the **dot product** of the two vectors.\n",
    "   - $ \\|A\\|  and  \\|B\\| $ are the magnitudes (lengths) of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cosine Similarity Between Movies:**\n",
    "   In your case, the vectors represent movies, and each dimension corresponds to a genre (since you're using a one-hot encoded dataframe `onehot_df` where the genres are represented as binary values).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Movies with **similar genre patterns** (e.g., both movies are action and adventure) will have a cosine similarity close to **1**.\n",
    "   - Movies with **very different genres** (e.g., one is comedy and the other is horror) will have a cosine similarity closer to **0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to Movies:\n",
    "- **Genres as Features**: If you represent each movie by a vector of its genres (like in your one-hot encoded `onehot_df`), then `cosine_similarity` calculates how similar two movies are based on their genre composition.\n",
    "   - For example, if Movie A is an **Action, Adventure** movie and Movie B is an **Action, Sci-Fi** movie, they will have a high cosine similarity because they share the **Action** genre.\n",
    "   - If Movie C is a **Romantic Comedy** and Movie D is a **Horror** movie, their cosine similarity will be low or zero, as they don't share any genres."
