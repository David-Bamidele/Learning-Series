# **Python Series Overview - Data Science Bootcamp**

### **Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python learning materials and projects from my **6-month Data Science Physical Bootcamp at [GOMYCODE Nigeria](https://gomycode.com)**. The bootcamp covers everything from basic Python concepts to advanced techniques, with hands-on mini projects to apply the knowledge gained throughout the series.

### **Contents**

The bootcamp curriculum is divided into various modules, starting from the basics and gradually building up to more complex concepts, with numerous mini-projects along the way. Below is an outline of the major sections:

#### **1. Basic Python Concepts**
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Conditionals and Loops
- Functions and Modules
- File Handling and Exceptions
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

#### **2. Intermediate Python**
- Advanced OOP Concepts
- List Comprehensions and Generators
- Lambda Functions, Map, Filter, and Reduce
- Error Handling and Logging
- Working with Libraries (NumPy, pandas, etc.)

#### **3. Data Analysis with Python**
- Introduction to Data Analysis
- Data Manipulation using pandas
- Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualization Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

#### **4. Python for Machine Learning**
- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- Feature Engineering and Model Evaluation
- Using Scikit-learn for building models

### **Mini Projects**

Throughout the series, we worked on a variety of mini-projects to apply what we learned. Some of these include:

- **Temperature Converter**: Building a small app to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Text-based Calculator**: Creating a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **Basic Data Analysis on a Public Dataset**: Conducting exploratory analysis on a dataset using pandas and visualizations.
- **Movie Recommendation System**: Developing a simple recommendation engine using cosine similarity.

### **Final Project**

The Python series concluded with a **capstone project** where we applied all the knowledge acquired over the bootcamp. The final project involved:

- **Problem Definition**: Identifying a problem and gathering relevant data.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models to address the problem.
- **Evaluation and Presentation**: Evaluating model performance and presenting insights and recommendations.

### **How to Use**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-series-datascience-bootcamp.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd python-series-datascience-bootcamp
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter notebooks**:
   Use Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to explore the code and projects.
